The Canadian housing market possesses key geographic variations, mainly stemming from differences across Ontario, British Columbia (BC), and Alberta. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of these provincial markets, focusing on recent news, trends, and sentiment.

## Ontario

The housing market in Ontario has experienced notable shifts in recent times [^1^][^2^]. In a year-to-year comparison, house prices reached a peak of $1.08 million by March 2022, followed by a precipitous fall of nearly 20%, dropping them back to levels seen in September 2021[^1^]. According to forecasts by TD Economics, this downward trend is to continue through early 2023 before bottoming out in the second half of the year[^1^].

Despite a decline in supply due to property owners' reluctance to list their properties, the market has seen a lessened demand attributed to higher interest rates[^1^]. The analysts also predict a slowing trend in new home construction[^1^]. ReMax forecasts further price falls in the Greater Toronto Area and to a greater extent in markets outside of it, particularly in Ontario's smaller cities with a higher proportion of houses to condos[^1^].

Yet, the future of Ontario's housing market is not entirely bleakï¿½the strong employment levels coupled with rising immigration numbers may potentially fuel the demand for housing[^1^]. This optimistic outlook is echoed by low volumes of listings and sales, despite the average sale price across Canada moving predictably toward a decline until Q2 2023 according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)[^1^].

In August 2023, Ontario's housing sales activity hit its lowest level in ten years, with home sales falling by 4% from the previous year[^2^]. Home prices decreased as well, highlighting the overarching trend of a slowing market[^2^]. Specialists attribute this cooling effect to the Bank of Canada rate hikes in June and July 2023[^2^]. These hikes affected all major Ontario housing markets, including Toronto where average home prices also fell by 3%[^2^]. 

According to predictions by RBC and TD, Ontario home prices are expected to decrease in 2023, however, a modest increase is anticipated for 2024[^2^].

## British Columbia (BC)

The housing market in British Columbia (BC) has proven resilient in the face of challenges[^4^]. Despite higher interest rates, both home sales and prices in BC have held firm[^4^]. Yet, forecasts predict cooling sales in the future due to the Bank of Canada tightening its monetary policy[^4^].

BC's housing market has run into significant highs and lows in 2023, with a sharp forecasted drop of 7.1% in residential sales in Q1 2023[^3^]. As a result, the BC housing market has been sluggish, marked by slow sales caused by high mortgage rates and a slowing economy[^3^].

However, there are promising signs of a strong rebound predicted by the British Columbia Real Estate Association for 2024[^3^]. This optimism is based on expectations of a stronger economy, lower mortgage rates, and record high migration rates, which typically fuel home sales[^3^].

## Alberta

The Alberta's housing market remained robust in August 2023, with home sales and benchmark home prices both reaching record highs despite recent rate hikes[^5^]. With a year-over-year increase of 20%, Alberta recorded high sales throughout the province[^5^]. This has resulted in a sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) of 77%, indicating a seller's market and putting upward pressure on home prices[^5^].

Immigration and population growth are key drivers of Alberta's housing market. Yet, recent rate hikes and inflation have affected the demand for real estate. Consequently, the Alberta market poses an increased risk of a major correction[^6^].

# Conclusion

The Canadian housing markets across Ontario, BC, and Alberta have faced turbulence and transformations. While Ontario's market is expected to cool off for now, the rising employment levels and immigration rates indicate a potential resurgence[^2^]. BC's housing market is putting up a fight against the constraints of higher interest rates, and experts predict a robust rebound[^3^][^4^]. In Alberta, the future of the housing market seems uncertain, with the possibility of a major market correction due to economic conditions[^5^][^6^].

It is worth noting that consumer sentiment plays a significant role in the real estate market dynamics. Changes in policy, economy, and population trends directly impact consumer sentiment, subsequently influencing market trends. Therefore, future market predictions should also take consumer sentiment into account.
